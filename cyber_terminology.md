# Terminology in Cyber Security

## Threat Vector
Threat Vector or attack vectors are the methods, process or mechanisms used by Cyber criminal to do cyber attack that enables them to gain unauthorized access, compromised the computer system and network access, exploit the vulnerabilities. Threat Vector can be Active or Passive.

- Passive attack - Eavesdropping or monitoring the data flow from or into the systems, the goal is to obatin as much as information during transimission without any alteration, modification or destroying the system. Examples - Phishing, Network Sniffing, Traffic Analysis.
- Active attack - In active attack, the attacker will directly interfere with the target to damage or gain unauthorized access to computer systems and networks. Examples-DDoS(Distributed Denial of Services) attack, Masquerading, Modification of Messages, Replay Attacks, Repudiation, Man-in the middle attacks.
- Threat Vector vs Attack Surface - An attack vector is a method of gaining unauthorized access to a network or computer system.
An attack surface is the total number of attack vectors an attacker can use to manipulate a network or computer system or extract data.

**Threat vector can be used interchangeably with attack vector and generally describes the potential ways a hacker can gain access to data or other confidential information.**


## Vulnerability
Vulnerability is a loophole, weakness, flaw or other shortcomings presents in a System (infrastructure, database, hardware & software), however it can also exist in a process, a set of controls, or simply just the way that something has been implemented or deployed.

Different types of Vulnerabilities available, but it is divided on two categories:

Technical Vulnerabilities: Hardware, Software or bugs in code or errors. in 2022, according to Positive Technologies, 72% of vulnerabilities were related to flaws in web application code.
Human Vulnerabilities: such as employees falling for phishing, smishing or other common attacks. The goal of 85% of these attacks is data theft.
## Exploit
In Cybersecurity, a exploit is any tools or techniques or piece of codes that attacker use to take advantge of vulnerability. Often, an exploit is delivered via a piece of code built to target that vulnerability such as (remote exploits, local exploits(physical system access ) or zero-days exploits).
## Threat
In Cybersecurity, anything that could exploit a vulnerability, which could affect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of your systems, data, people, and more.

A more advanced definition of threat is when an adversary or attacker has the opportunity, capability and intent to bring a negative impact upon your operations, assets, workforce and/or customers. Examples of this can include malware, ransomware, phishing attacks and more — and the types of threats out there will continue to evolve.

For example, your organization may have no vulnerabilities to exploit due to a solid patch management program or strong network segmentation policies that prevent access to critical systems. However, in the real world, chances are extremely likely that you do have vulnerabilities, so let’s consider the risk factor.
## Risk
In general, Risk = Likelihood × Impact. Vulnerability and threat are the sources for a risks.

## Impact
## Governance
## Compliance
## PII (Personal Identifiable Information)
PII are the data used to uniquely idenfifies an individuals.
For example: Name, Email, Address, Phone numbers, Date of Birth, Social Security numbers etc.

## SIEM (Splunk, ELK Stack)
## SOAR ()
## MISSP
## IDPS (Snort, Suricata)
## Firewall (Pfsense)
## EDR / XDR (Wazuh)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Phishing
Phishing is one of the most effective cybersecurity threat vectors; it has defeated even the most sophisticated cyber defense systems by preying on people’s weaknesses.

## KQL (Kusto Query Language )
KQL can refer to Kusto Query Language in the context of Azure, and Kibana Query Language in the context of Elastic. Both are query languages used to explore and process data based on search terms and filters.

## Kibana
Kibana is a web-based visualisation tool for exploring data stored in Elasticsearch. It can be used to create interactive dashboards and charts that help users to understand data.

KQL, or Kibana Query Language, is an easy-to-use language that can be used to search documents for values. For example, querying if a value within a field exists or matches a value. If you are familiar with Splunk, you may be thinking of SPL (Search Processing Language).
