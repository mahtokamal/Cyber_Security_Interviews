## Explain Black Hat, White Hat, and Gray Hat Hackers?
Black Hat(Unethical hacker) having malicious intent are hackers, to gain unauthorized and illegal access to the computer system for the purpose of personal gain(stealing data).

White Hat(Ethical hacker) having without malicious intent are hackers, to protect the system and report it to the companies withing legal boundaries.

Gray hat hackers fall somewhere in the category between white hat and black hat hackers. They are not legally authorized hackers. They work with both good and bad intentions, they can use their skills for personal gain. It all depends upon the hacker.

**Other Types of Hackers** <br>
- Script Kiddies: They are young juvenile and unskilled hackers, who uses online availble free tools or scripts provided by hackers to compromise or disrupt the system and their sole purpose is to gain attention from Friends and Societies.

- State/Nation Sponsored Hackers: They are highy-skilled, appointed, funded and supported by their Governments to gain confidential information through cyber attack to stay ahead of their competitior party or to avoid any kind of danger or threat to their own country.

- Hacktivist: These are also called the online versions of the activists. Hacktivist is a hacker or a group of anonymous hackers who gain unauthorized access to government’s computer files and networks for further social or political ends.
  
- Malicious Insider or Whistleblower: A malicious insider or a whistleblower could be an employee of a company or a government agency with a grudge or a strategic employee who becomes aware of any illegal activities happening within the organization and can blackmail the organization for his/her personal gain.

- Blue Hat Hackers: They are much like the white hat hackers, they work for companies for security testing of their software right before the product launch. Blue hat hackers are outsourced by the company unlike white hat hackers which are employed by the (part of the) company.

- Red Hat Hackers: They are also known as the eagle-eyed hackers. Like white hat hackers, red hat hackers also aims to halt the black hat hackers. There is a major difference in the way they operate. They become ruthless while dealing with malware actions of the black hat hackers. Red hat hacker will keep on attacking the hacker aggressively that the hacker may know it as well have to replace the whole system.
  
- Green Hat Hackers: They are also amateurs in the world of hacking but they are bit different from script kiddies. They care about hacking and strive to become full-blown hackers. They are inspired by the hackers and ask them few questions about. While hackers are answering their question they will listen to its novelty.

6. What is a Firewall?

7. Is a Security Misconfiguration a Vulnerability?

yes, Security misconfiguration is one of the common vulnerabilities that may happen to systems, applications, and infrastructure and let organizations be exposed to possible cyberattacks. These security misconfigurations involve human error, security settings overlooked, or best practices not put into place. Some of the most common security misconfiguration examples  are mentioned here, along with an example of their causes possibly:

Unnecessary Open Ports

Unpatched Security Patches

Overly Permissive Access:

HTTPS Not Enabled

Configuration Settings Not Changed:

Poorly Configured Firewalls:

Directory Listings Enabled:

Not Changing Default Credentials:

## Define vulnerability in your own words?
Vulnerability is a loophole, weakness, flaw or other shortcomings presents in a System (infrastructure, database, hardware & software), however it can also exist in a process, a set of controls, or simply just the way that something has been implemented or deployed.

Different types of Vulnerabilities available, but it is divided on two categories:
- Technical Vulnerabilities: Hardware, Software or bugs in code or errors. in 2022, according to Positive Technologies, 72% of vulnerabilities were related to flaws in web application code.
- Human Vulnerabilities: such as employees falling for phishing, smishing or other common attacks. The goal of 85% of these attacks is data theft.

## Define Exploits?
In Cybersecurity, a exploit is any tools or techniques or piece of codes that attacker use to take advantge of vulnerability.
 Often, an exploit is delivered via a piece of code built to target that vulnerability such as (remote exploits, local exploits(physical system access ) or zero-days exploits)
 
## Define threat in your own words?
In Cybersecurity, anything that could exploit a vulnerability, which could affect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of your systems, data, people, and more.

A more advanced definition of threat is when an adversary or attacker has the opportunity, capability and intent to bring a negative impact upon your operations, assets, workforce and/or customers. Examples of this can include malware, ransomware, phishing attacks and more — and the types of threats out there will continue to evolve.

For example, your organization may have no vulnerabilities to exploit due to a solid patch management program or strong network segmentation policies that prevent access to critical systems. However, in the real world, chances are extremely likely that you do have vulnerabilities, so let’s consider the risk factor.

## Define risk in your own words?
In general, Risk = Likelihood × Impact. Vulnerability and threat are the sources for a risks.

Risk is the probability of a negative (harmful) event occurring as well as the potential of scale of that harm. Your organizational risk fluctuates over time, sometimes even on a daily basis, due to both internal and external factors.

In order for organizations to begin risk mitigation and risk management, you first need to understand your vulnerabilities and the threats to those vulnerabilities.

**Real-world example**<br>
Your organization might be looking to protect all its data, likely through data encryption methods and other approaches. But this approach is incredibly expensive, so you must pare down which ones to protect the best.<br>

You could think about the risk involved in this way: if the mechanism for protecting certain data fails in some way, you’ll have one or more vulnerabilities. And if there is a threat actor who finds and exploits this vulnerability, the threat is realized.<br>

Here, your risk is how valuable it would be to lose that data to the threat actor.<br>

NOTE: Risk comes with universal truth: you cannot eliminate or entirely protect against all threats, no matter how advanced your systems are.

## Vulnerability vs threat vs risk
These terms are frequently used together, but they do explain three separate components of cybersecurity. In short, we can see them as a spectrum:

First, a **vulnerability(weakness or flaw)** exposes your organization to threats.

A **threat(causes harm, damage or loss)** is a malicious or negative event that takes advantage of a vulnerability.

Finally, the **risk** is the potential for loss and damage when the threat does occur.

## Impact
 It refers to the negative consequences that occur when a cyberattack or security incident successfully compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an organization's or individual's digital assets.
 
- Technical Impact: (Hardware system, software, servers)
- Business Impact: (losing trust of customer, reputational damage)

Consequences and types of the impact:
- Financial Impact
- Reputational Impact
- Operational Impact (System Downtime or unavailability of services)


## Define Governance?
GRC stands for governance, risk (management), and compliance.

Governance is the set of policies, rules, or frameworks that a company uses to achieve its business goals. It defines the responsibilities of key stakeholders, such as the board of directors and senior management.

## Define Compliance?
Compliance is the act of following rules, laws, standards and regulations. It applies to legal and regulatory requirements set by industrial bodies and also for internal corporate policies. In GRC, compliance involves implementing procedures to ensure that business activities comply with the respective regulations.
For example, healthcare organizations must comply with laws like HIPAA that protect patients' privacy.

GDPR(Genera Data Protection Regulations) (to maintain data confidentiality and privacy of individuals), is a European Union regulation on information privacy in the European Union and the European Economic Area.
