# Most commonly Cyber Security Interview Questions?

## How do you stay updated with Information Security?
I follow Cyber Security experts, newsletter, online articles, attending webinar, youtube channels, LinkedIn groups etc.

## Explain Black Hat, White Hat, and Gray Hat Hackers?
Black Hat(Unethical hacker) having malicious intent are hackers, to gain unauthorized and illegal access to the computer system for the purpose of personal gain(stealing data).

White Hat(Ethical hacker) having without malicious intent are hackers, to protect the system and report it to the companies withing legal boundaries.

Gray hat hackers fall somewhere in the category between white hat and black hat hackers. They are not legally authorized hackers. They work with both good and bad intentions, they can use their skills for personal gain. It all depends upon the hacker.

**Other Types of Hackers** <br>
- Script Kiddies: They are young juvenile and unskilled hackers, who uses online availble free tools or scripts provided by hackers to compromise or disrupt the system and their sole purpose is to gain attention from Friends and Societies.

- State/Nation Sponsored Hackers: They are highy-skilled, appointed, funded and supported by their Governments to gain confidential information through cyber attack to stay ahead of their competitior party or to avoid any kind of danger or threat to their own country.

- Hacktivist: These are also called the online versions of the activists. Hacktivist is a hacker or a group of anonymous hackers who gain unauthorized access to government’s computer files and networks for further social or political ends.
  
- Malicious Insider or Whistleblower: A malicious insider or a whistleblower could be an employee of a company or a government agency with a grudge or a strategic employee who becomes aware of any illegal activities happening within the organization and can blackmail the organization for his/her personal gain.

- Blue Hat Hackers: They are much like the white hat hackers, they work for companies for security testing of their software right before the product launch. Blue hat hackers are outsourced by the company unlike white hat hackers which are employed by the (part of the) company.

- Red Hat Hackers: They are also known as the eagle-eyed hackers. Like white hat hackers, red hat hackers also aims to halt the black hat hackers. There is a major difference in the way they operate. They become ruthless while dealing with malware actions of the black hat hackers. Red hat hacker will keep on attacking the hacker aggressively that the hacker may know it as well have to replace the whole system.
  
- Green Hat Hackers: They are also amateurs in the world of hacking but they are bit different from script kiddies. They care about hacking and strive to become full-blown hackers. They are inspired by the hackers and ask them few questions about. While hackers are answering their question they will listen to its novelty.

## What is Port Scanning?
Port scanning is a method used to identify open ports and services running on a host. It's used in reconnaissance by attackers and during vulnerability assessments by defenders.This information helps an attacker (or a security analyst) understand what services are running on the target and potentially identify vulnerabilities associated with those services.

## Do you know any programming language?
Yes, I have foundational knowledge of Python that I used in Cyber Forensic Intern at Cyber Dosti for my project file signature analysis using Python-Magic Library. Apart this, I also have basic hands-on experience with BASH and Powershell scripting languages.

## Define Red Team and Blue Team?
Red Team (simulates the offensive techniques) plays the role of attacking the system to gain unauthorized access.

Blue Team (simulates the defensive techniques) plays the role of protecting and safeguards the system from Red Team as well as from real-world attacks.

## What is a Firewall?
Firewall can be Hardware / Software, used to monitors and filters the inbound and outbound network traffics based on predefined security rules or policy. On the basis of rules, it can allow, deny and block the traffics that goes to or exit from the system.

## Is a Security Misconfiguration a Vulnerability?
yes, Security misconfiguration is one of the common vulnerabilities that may happen to systems, applications, and infrastructure and let organizations be exposed to possible cyberattacks. These security misconfigurations involve human error, security settings overlooked, or best practices not put into place. Some of the most common security misconfiguration examples  are mentioned here, along with an example of their causes possibly:
- Unnecessary Open Ports
- Unpatched Security Patches
- Overly Permissive Access:
- HTTPS Not Enabled
- Configuration Settings Not Changed:
- Poorly Configured Firewalls:
- Directory Listings Enabled:
- Not Changing Default Credentials:

## Define vulnerability in your own words?
Vulnerability is a loophole, weakness, flaw or other shortcomings presents in a System (infrastructure, database, hardware & software), however it can also exist in a process, a set of controls, or simply just the way that something has been implemented or deployed.

Different types of Vulnerabilities available, but it is divided on two categories:
- Technical Vulnerabilities: Hardware, Software or bugs in code or errors. in 2022, according to Positive Technologies, 72% of vulnerabilities were related to flaws in web application code.
- Human Vulnerabilities: such as employees falling for phishing, smishing or other common attacks. The goal of 85% of these attacks is data theft.

## Define Exploits?
In Cybersecurity, a exploit is any tools or techniques or piece of codes that attacker use to take advantge of vulnerability.
 Often, an exploit is delivered via a piece of code built to target that vulnerability such as (remote exploits, local exploits(physical system access ) or zero-days exploits)
 
## Define threat in your own words?
In Cybersecurity, anything that could exploit a vulnerability, which could affect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of your systems, data, people, and more.

A more advanced definition of threat is when an adversary or attacker has the opportunity, capability and intent to bring a negative impact upon your operations, assets, workforce and/or customers. Examples of this can include malware, ransomware, phishing attacks and more — and the types of threats out there will continue to evolve.

For example, your organization may have no vulnerabilities to exploit due to a solid patch management program or strong network segmentation policies that prevent access to critical systems. However, in the real world, chances are extremely likely that you do have vulnerabilities, so let’s consider the risk factor.

## Define risk in your own words?
In general, Risk = Likelihood × Impact. Vulnerability and threat are the sources for a risks.

![Screenshot (456)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a71df272-33ec-4e29-a96f-b4ad6adec98b)


Risk is the probability of a negative (harmful) event occurring as well as the potential of scale of that harm. Your organizational risk fluctuates over time, sometimes even on a daily basis, due to both internal and external factors.

In order for organizations to begin risk mitigation and risk management, you first need to understand your vulnerabilities and the threats to those vulnerabilities.

**Real-world example**<br>
Your organization might be looking to protect all its data, likely through data encryption methods and other approaches. But this approach is incredibly expensive, so you must pare down which ones to protect the best.<br>

You could think about the risk involved in this way: if the mechanism for protecting certain data fails in some way, you’ll have one or more vulnerabilities. And if there is a threat actor who finds and exploits this vulnerability, the threat is realized.<br>

Here, your risk is how valuable it would be to lose that data to the threat actor.<br>

NOTE: Risk comes with universal truth: you cannot eliminate or entirely protect against all threats, no matter how advanced your systems are.

## Vulnerability vs threat vs risk
These terms are frequently used together, but they do explain three separate components of cybersecurity. In short, we can see them as a spectrum:

First, a **vulnerability(weakness or flaw)** exposes your organization to threats.

A **threat(causes harm, damage or loss)** is a malicious or negative event that takes advantage of a vulnerability.

Finally, the **risk** is the potential for loss and damage when the threat does occur.

## Impact
 It refers to the negative consequences that occur when a cyberattack or security incident successfully compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an organization's or individual's digital assets.
 
- Technical Impact: (Hardware system, software, servers)
- Business Impact: (losing trust of customer, reputational damage)

Consequences and types of the impact:
- Financial Impact
- Reputational Impact
- Operational Impact (System Downtime or unavailability of services)


## Define Governance?
GRC stands for governance, risk (management), and compliance.

Governance is the set of policies, rules, or frameworks that a company uses to achieve its business goals. It defines the responsibilities of key stakeholders, such as the board of directors and senior management.

## Define Compliance?
Compliance is the act of following rules, laws, standards and regulations realted to information security . It applies to legal and regulatory requirements set by industrial bodies and also for internal corporate policies. In GRC, compliance involves implementing procedures to ensure that business activities comply with the respective regulations.
For example, healthcare organizations must comply with laws like HIPAA that protect patients' privacy.

GDPR(Genera Data Protection Regulations) (to maintain data confidentiality and privacy of individuals), is a European Union regulation on information privacy in the European Union and the European Economic Area.



## What is the MITRE ATT&CK framework and why is it used for?
MITRE ATT&CK(Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) framework, is a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. It helps to map and understand attacker behaviors during the kill chain.

It is a guideline for classifying and describing cyberattacks and intrusions. It was created by the Mitre Corporation and released in 2013 and used for threat modeling and profiling.
The framework is an alternative to the cyber kill chain developed by Lockheed Martin.

|Tactics|Techniques|
|----|---|
|Reconnaissance|Active Scanning, Phishing for information|

## Explain Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) in your own words?
In simple terms, 2FA is a two-way of identifying yourself before getting access to a system (can be a password along with biometric or one time code).
2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring two forms of verification: something you know (password) and something you have (authenticator app or device). This makes it much harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access, even if they manage to steal your password.

## What was your last project? Tell me what you did and how you deployed it?
Confired IAM policies using AWS CLI and Terraform (Infrastructure as Code(IaC)) Understanding how to manage users, groups, roles, and permissions on AWS cloud platforms to enforce least privilege.

## What is the C.I.A triad?
- Confidentiality (C): Ensure data privacy and prevent unauthorized access.
- Integrity (I): Ensure (tampering-proof, without alteratin of data)data isn't altered.
- Availability (A): Ensure services/data are accessible when needed.

## What is an Indicator of Compromise (IoCs)?
Indicator of Compromise(IoCs) acts as a sign or proof that a system has been compromised of cyber attack. IOCs can include things like unusual network traffic, suspicious file hashes,IP addresses, unexpected registry entries, the presence of known malware signatures, or anomalous login attempts. Security analysts use IOCs to detect past or ongoing intrusions and to inform their threat hunting efforts.

## What's the difference between a true positive and a false positive alert?

True Positive (TP): A True Positive result is a correct identification of a threat or vulnerability by a system or tool. This means that the system has correctly detected and identified a potential threat or vulnerability, and has taken the appropriate action to mitigate or eliminate it. For example, if an intrusion detection system (IDS) correctly detects and reports an attempted cyber-attack, it would be considered a True Positive. This type of result is crucial in ensuring the safety and security of computer systems and networks. <br>

True Negative(TN): A True Negative result is a correct determination that no threat or vulnerability exists by a system or tool. This means that the system has determined that there is no potential threat or vulnerability, and has taken no action. For example, if an antivirus software determines that a file is not infected with a virus and it is indeed clean, it would be considered a True Negative. This type of result is just as important as True Positives, as it helps to prevent unnecessary actions and alerts that could create confusion or panic. <br>

False Positive(FP): A False Positive result is an incorrect identification of a threat or vulnerability by a system or tool. This means that the system has detected something that is not actually a potential threat or vulnerability and has taken unnecessary action. For example, if an IDS incorrectly identifies legitimate network traffic as an attempted cyber-attack, it would be considered a False Positive. This type of result can be frustrating for users and can lead to wasted time and resources. <br>

False Negative(FN): A False Negative result is a failure to identify a threat or vulnerability by a system or tool. This means that the system has missed a potential threat or vulnerability, and has taken no action to mitigate or eliminate it. For example, if an antivirus software fails to detect a virus in a file that is actually infected, it would be considered a False Negative. This type of result can be dangerous as it can allow threats and vulnerabilities to go undetected and potentially cause harm to computer systems and networks. <br>

Benign or Neutral: A Benign or Neutral result is one where the system or tool detects activity or behavior, but it is determined to be harmless or not a threat. For example, if an IDS detects network traffic that is determined to be legitimate and not an attempted cyber-attack, it would be considered a Benign or Neutral result. This type of result is important to identify because it helps to reduce the number of False Positives and False Negatives, which can reduce the workload of security analysts and improve the accuracy of threat detection.

## What is DHCP?
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol assigns IP addresses to devices on a network automatically and other network configuration parameters (like subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server addresses) to devices on a network. This eliminates the need for manual configuration, simplifies network administration, and prevents IP address conflicts.

## What is the difference between IDS and IPS?
IDS : Intrusion Detectin System, it only monitors the security events and notify us through alerts for unusual network activitiy and doesn't take any actions automatically, required a security experts to deal with the events. <br>

IPS : Intrusion Prevention System, it monitors and blocks the security events or malicious network activity, it automatically take the actions required to prevent or block the unusual activity.

## How many OWASP top 10 can you name and can you explain how any of them work?

- Static Malware Analysis: Involves examining the malware's code and structure without actually executing it. This includes techniques like disassembling the code, analyzing file headers, strings, and identifying known malicious patterns or signatures. Static analysis can quickly provide insights into the malware's potential capabilities and characteristics. However, it can be evaded by techniques like code obfuscation or packing.

- Involves executing the malware in a controlled and isolated environment (like a sandbox) and observing its behavior in real-time. This allows analysts to see what actions the malware takes, such as network connections, file modifications, registry changes, and process creation. Dynamic analysis can reveal the actual impact and functionality of the malware, even if it uses obfuscation techniques. However, malware can sometimes detect sandbox environments and behave differently.


**OWASP TOP 10** <br>
OWASP stands for Open Web Application Secruity Project. The OWASP Top 10 is a list of the 10 most critical web application security risks, published by the Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP). It’s a non-profit foundation, globally recognized standard used by developers, security professionals, and organizations to secure web applications.

- A01:2021-Broken Access Control
- A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures
- A03:2021-Injection
- A04:2021-Insecure Design
- A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration
- A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components
- A07:2021-Identification and Authentication Failures
- A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures
- A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
- A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery 

## Can you explain SQL injection?
It's when an attacker manipulates SQL queries through input fields to access or manipulate a database.
SQL Injection occurs when an attacker can insert malicious SQL queries into an application's input fields (like login forms, search bars, or URL parameters). If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate this input, the malicious SQL code can be executed against the backend database. This can allow the attacker to bypass authentication, retrieve sensitive data, modify or delete data, or even gain control over the database server.

For example, consider a login form where a user enters a username and password. The application might construct an SQL query like: <br>
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password'; <br>

If the application doesn't properly handle the $username input, an attacker could enter something like: <br>
' OR '1'='1 <br>

This would result in the following malicious SQL query: <br>

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = '$password'; <br>

Since '1'='1' is always true, this query would bypass the username and password check, potentially granting the attacker unauthorized access. <br>

is a type of injection vulnerability that allows attackers to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. By inserting malicious SQL statements into input fields, attackers can bypass security measures, view, modify, or delete data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server. <br>


## Can you explain Cross-Site Scripting?
It allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into websites, which execute in the browser of users who view the page.<br>
is a type of web application vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts (usually JavaScript) into web pages viewed by other users. When a victim visits the compromised page, their browser executes the attacker's script. This can enable the attacker to steal session cookies, redirect the user to malicious websites, deface the website, or perform other malicious actions in the context of the victim's browser session. <br>

There are typically three types of XSS: <br>

- Reflected XSS: The malicious script is injected through a request (e.g., in a URL parameter) and is reflected back to the user in the response.
- Stored XSS: The malicious script is stored on the target server (e.g., in a database or comment section) and is executed whenever a user views the affected content. This is generally more dangerous.
- DOM-based XSS: The vulnerability exists in the client-side JavaScript code itself, where malicious data in the DOM (Document Object Model) is used without proper sanitization.

## How is a Web Application Firewall different from a regular Firewall?
is a specific type of firewall that focuses on protecting web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP(S) traffic between the application and the internet. Unlike a traditional network firewall that operates at lower network layers (like IP addresses and ports), a WAF understands the application layer (HTTP) and can analyze the content of web requests and responses. <br>

## What is the difference between encoding, encryption, and hashing?
- Encoding : converting plain-text(readable) into cipher-text(unreadable) without using key. It is reversible.Examples- Base64, URL encoding
- Encryption : converting plain-text(readable) into cipher-text(unreadable) using key. It is reversible. Examples- DES, AES, RSA, Caesar Cipher.
- Decryption: converting back to plain-text from cipher-text using key.
- Hashing : it is a one-way process and used for data integrity checking. it is not reversible. Examples- MD-5, SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3.

Symmetric : One key(Public key) used for encryption and decryption. <br>

Asymmetric : different keys are used for encrytpion and decryption. Public key for encrytpion and Private key for decryption. <br>

Digital Signature: Data authentication and Data Integrity. <br>

## If you were going to going to encrypt a file, would you compress it before or after you encrypt it?
Compress before encrypting. Encryption randomizes data, making it harder to compress afterward. <br>
Reduced File Size: Compression reduces the size of the data, which can lead to faster encryption times and less storage space required for the encrypted file.<br>
Increased Entropy: Compression can sometimes increase the entropy (randomness) of the data. This can make the ciphertext more resistant to certain types of cryptanalysis, as patterns in the original data are reduced. <br>
Encrypting first and then compressing might not be as effective because encryption aims to introduce randomness, which can hinder the compression algorithm's ability to find patterns and reduce the file size. <br>

## Explain salted hashes?
A salt is a random value( character, numbers or strings) added to passwords before hashing to prevent dictionary and rainbow table attacks. <br>

- Prevents Rainbow Table Attacks: Rainbow tables are pre-computed tables of hashes for common passwords. Without salting, an attacker who obtains a database of password hashes can potentially use these tables to quickly look up the original passwords. Since each password has a unique salt, the resulting hashes will be different, making rainbow tables ineffective.

- Increases Difficulty of Dictionary Attacks: Even if attackers try to guess common passwords and hash them, the added salt makes it much harder to match the generated hash with the stored salted hash. They would need to generate hashes for each password combined with each unique salt, which is computationally very expensive.

## How does an attacker gain persistence when they've successfully entered?
By installing backdoors, modifying registry keys, using scheduled tasks, or creating rogue user accounts. <br>

Once an attacker has successfully gained initial access to a system, they often try to establish persistence to maintain their access even if the initial entry point is closed or the system is rebooted. They achieve this through various techniques: <br>

- Registry Keys: Modifying or adding Run keys in the Windows Registry to automatically execute malicious programs at startup or logon.
- Startup Folders: Placing malicious executables or shortcuts in startup folders so they run when a user logs in.   
- Scheduled Tasks: Creating scheduled tasks to run malicious scripts or executables at specific times or intervals.   
- Services: Installing malicious software as a service that runs in the background, often with elevated privileges.
- Backdoors: Planting hidden mechanisms (like remote access tools or modified system files) that allow them to re-enter the system later.   
- Web Shells: Uploading malicious scripts to web servers that allow them to execute commands remotely through a web browser.   
- Account Manipulation: Creating new administrator accounts or adding their existing account to privileged groups.
- SSH Keys: Installing their own SSH keys for passwordless remote access.

## Can you name the three major windows event log types?
The three major Windows event log types are: <br>

- Application: Contains events logged by applications and programs. Developers often use this log to record errors, warnings, and informational events specific to their applications.   <br>
- Security: Contains audit entries related to security events, such as successful and failed logon attempts, object access, privilege use, and account management changes. This log is crucial for security investigations.   <br>
- System: Contains events logged by the Windows operating system components, such as startup and shutdown events, driver errors, and system service failures. <br>

## Name a sandbox that you like?
Hybrid analysis, Joesandbox, any.run. <br>

## What is the difference between static and dynamic malware analysis?
- Static Malware Analysis: Involves examining the malware's code and structure without actually executing it. This includes techniques like disassembling the code, analyzing file headers, strings, and identifying known malicious patterns or signatures. Static analysis can quickly provide insights into the malware's potential capabilities and characteristics. However, it can be evaded by techniques like code obfuscation or packing.

- Dynamic Malware Analysis: Involves executing the malware in a controlled and isolated environment (like a sandbox) and observing its behavior in real-time. This allows analysts to see what actions the malware takes, such as network connections, file modifications, registry changes, and process creation. Dynamic analysis can reveal the actual impact and functionality of the malware, even if it uses obfuscation techniques. However, malware can sometimes detect sandbox environments and behave differently.

## What is a SIEM? Tell me when you've used one
SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management. The primary goal of a SIEM is to provide a centralized view of security-related data, enabling real-time monitoring, threat detection, security analysis, and incident response. <br>
I’ve used SIEM (Splunk and ELK or Elastic Stack) to analyze logs, detect anomalies, and set up alerts. <br>

## Name a few online tools you use for security analysis?

|C, 192.168.0.0/16|192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255|

## Do you know anything about Zero Trust?
It's a security framework based on the principle of "never trust, always verify." <br>
Zero Trust ensures that every user and device must strictly identifies before accessing the network or system irrespective whether it is internal or external entities.

## Do you have any experience with PCI or another compliance body?
I don't have practical experience with PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) compliance. However, I know the theoretical foundation knowledge about such as How does it work in real-work and why is it neccessary?

## What is the difference between TCP and UDP?

|TCP| UDP|
|---|---|
|TCP is connection-oriented|UDP is connection-less|
|TCP ensure reliable delivery of data (3-way handshake, SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)|UDP does not ensure reliable delivery of data|
|Slower|Faster|
|web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), email (SMTP, POP3, IMAP), and file transfer (FTP)|Streaming(audio and video), online  gaming, DNS queries|

## Explain your experience with Azure and AWS?
My experience with Azure and AWS is primarily through understanding their security services and how they can be leveraged for building and monitoring secure cloud environments. I have knowledge of: <br>

- Configured IAM policies on AWS platform and CloudWatch to monitor AWS logs, IaC(Terraform, infrastructure as a code to deploy, test and destroy the code creating ec2 instance) and AWS CLI.
- T-Pot(Honey Pot) on Microsoft Azure platform and security analysis on source IP and using Terraform azure CLI to create resource group

- Identity and Access Management (IAM): Understanding how to manage users, groups, roles, and permissions in both platforms to enforce least privilege.
Network Security: Familiarity with Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) and AWS Security Groups and Network ACLs for controlling inbound and outbound traffic.

- Security Monitoring and Logging: Awareness of Azure Security Center/Microsoft Defender for Cloud and AWS Security Hub for centralized security management and threat detection, as well as their respective logging services (Azure Monitor Logs/Log Analytics and AWS CloudWatch Logs).
  
- Data Protection: Understanding encryption options at rest and in transit, as well as key management services (Azure Key Vault and AWS KMS).

- Web Application Firewalls (WAF): Knowledge of Azure WAF and AWS WAF for protecting web applications from common web exploits.

While my direct hands-on deployment experience in these platforms might be limited, I have a solid understanding of their core security concepts and how they contribute to a secure cloud infrastructure. <br>

## What is port 80?
Port 80 is the standard port used for HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), which is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. When you type a website address (URL) that starts with "http://", your browser typically connects to the web server on port 80 to request and receive web pages and other content. <br>

## What is port 443?
Port 443 is the standard port used for HTTPS (HTTP Secure), which is the secure version of HTTP. It uses TLS/SSL encryption to provide secure communication over the internet, protecting the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between the browser and the web server. Websites that handle sensitive information (like login credentials or payment details) typically use HTTPS and operate on port 443.

## Is a VPN necessary? Why or why not?

Whether a VPN (Virtual Private Network) is necessary depends heavily on the context and the user's needs and threat model: <br>

Reasons why a VPN can be beneficial: <br>

- Privacy: Encrypts your internet traffic and masks your IP address, making it harder for websites, ISPs, and potential eavesdroppers to track your online activity.
- Security on Public Wi-Fi: Protects your data from interception when using unsecured public Wi-Fi networks.
- Bypassing Geo-restrictions: Allows access to content that might be blocked in your geographical location.
- Secure Remote Access: Enables secure connections to private networks (like a company network) for remote workers.

Reasons why a VPN might not always be necessary: <br>

- HTTPS: Many websites now use HTTPS, which already encrypts the communication between your browser and the server, providing a level of security.
- Trusted Private Networks: On your secure home or office network, the added layer of a VPN might not be essential for basic browsing.
- Performance Overhead: VPNs can sometimes introduce latency and reduce internet speed.
- Trust in VPN Provider: You are essentially trusting your VPN provider with your internet traffic.

In conclusion, a VPN can be a valuable tool for enhancing privacy and security, especially on untrusted networks. However, it's not a universal necessity, and its usefulness depends on individual circumstances and security requirements.

## What is port 22?
Port 22 is the standard port used for SSH (Secure Shell). SSH is a secure protocol used for establishing encrypted connections between two networked devices. It's commonly used for remote server administration, secure file transfer (SFTP, SCP), and creating secure tunnels for other network traffic.

## What is port 3389?
Port 3389 is the standard port used for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). RDP is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft that allows users to remotely access and control the graphical interface of another computer over a network connection.

## What is port 445 and what malware is notorious for flooding it?
Port 445 is the standard port used for Server Message Block (SMB), which is a network file-sharing protocol used by Windows operating systems (and also implemented by other systems like Samba for Linux/Unix).<br>

The malware family most notorious for flooding port 445 and exploiting vulnerabilities in the SMB protocol is WannaCry. The WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017 used the EternalBlue exploit (developed by the NSA and later leaked) to spread rapidly across networks by exploiting a vulnerability in the SMBv1 protocol on port 445.

## Are source ports good for anything in an investigation?
Yes—they help in identifying services, behavior patterns, and can be used in correlation. <br>

- Identifying the Originating Application/Process: Each application or process initiating a network connection typically uses a unique, ephemeral (temporary) source port. By examining the source port in network logs, you can sometimes identify the specific application or process on the originating machine that initiated the communication.
- Tracking Connections: Source ports, along with source IP address, destination IP address, and destination port, form a unique 5-tuple that identifies a specific network connection. This can be crucial for tracking the flow of communication during an incident.
- Detecting Anomalous Activity: Unusual or unexpected source ports used by a particular host might indicate malicious activity or the presence of unauthorized software.
- Correlation with Endpoint Logs: Source port information in network logs can be correlated with local logs on the originating endpoint to gain a more complete picture of the events leading up to or during an incident. For example, matching a network connection with a specific process ID and timestamp in the endpoint logs.


## When you type in your computer google.com tell me what happens on your computer to get you the website?
Here is the simplified steps what happens behind the scence when you type google.com <br>

- DNS resolves domain to IP.
- TCP connection is established.
- HTTP(S) request is made.
- Web page is served to browser.

Following explains the detail behind google.com <br>

- DNS Resolution: Your computer first needs to find the IP address associated with the domain name google.com. It sends a DNS query to your configured DNS server (usually provided by your ISP or a custom DNS service).
- DNS Lookup: The DNS server recursively queries other DNS servers until it finds the IP address for google.com.
Establishing a TCP Connection: Once your computer has the IP address for google.com, your browser initiates a TCP connection to the web server on the standard HTTPS port 443 (since most modern websites use HTTPS by default). This involves a three-way handshake:
- SYN (Synchronize): Your computer sends a SYN packet to the server.
- SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge): The server responds with a SYN-ACK packet.
- ACK (Acknowledge): Your computer sends an ACK packet, establishing the connection.
- TLS/SSL Handshake (for HTTPS): Because you're likely accessing https://google.com, a TLS/SSL handshake occurs to establish a secure, encrypted connection. This involves the browser and server exchanging certificates and agreeing on encryption algorithms.
- HTTP Request: Your browser sends an HTTP GET request to the Google server, asking for the main webpage (/). This request includes information like your browser type (user-agent).
- HTTP Response: The Google server processes your request and sends back an HTTP response. This response contains the HTML code for the Google homepage, along with other resources like CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, and images.
- Rendering the Page: Your web browser receives the HTTP response and starts to render the webpage by parsing the HTML, fetching the additional resources, and displaying the Google homepage on your screen.

## What is DNS?
DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical and distributed naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the internet or a private network. It translates human-readable domain names (like google.com) into machine-readable IP addresses (like 172.217.160.142). <br>

Think of DNS as the phonebook of the internet. Instead of having to remember complex numerical IP addresses for every website you want to visit, you can use easy-to-remember domain names. When you type a domain name into your browser, DNS works behind the scenes to look up the corresponding IP address so your computer can connect to the correct server. This system is crucial for the internet to be user-friendly and functional.

## Data exfiltration
Data Exfiltration—also known as data theft, data leakage, or data breach—is when sensitive, confidential, or proprietary data is stolen or transferred out of an organization without authorization. <br>
In simple terms, Data exfiltration is the unauthorized transfer of data from a computer or network. <br>
It's one of the most dangerous outcomes of a cyberattack and a major focus for SOC analysts and incident response teams. <br>

How Does It Happen? <br>
- Malware (keyloggers, backdoors, RATs)
- Phishing attacks (gaining user credentials)
- Misconfigured cloud storage (like open S3 buckets)
- Insider threats (disgruntled or careless employees)
- Command & Control (C2) channels in APTs

🌐 Real-World Examples: <br>
1. Equifax Breach (2017)
- Attackers exploited a vulnerability in Apache Struts.
- Exfiltrated personal info of 147 million people (SSNs, birthdates, etc.).
 - Data was transferred out over several weeks before detection.

2. Capital One Breach (2019)
- Misconfigured AWS firewall allowed access to cloud data.
- An insider/ex-employee used that to exfiltrate credit applications of over 100 million users.

3. Edward Snowden (NSA Leak, 2013)
- Insider copied and exfiltrated highly classified NSA data.
- Used removable media and anonymizing tools.

## What is DMZ(Demilitarized Zone) in Cyber Security?

A DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) is a perimeter network that sits between an organization's internal network (trusted or LAN) and the public internet (untrusted). It hosts public-facing services like DNS, web, email, FTP, or VoIP servers while keeping your internal network safe. <br>

## Cyber Kill Chain (Rec, Weap, Del, Expl, Inst, C2, Act)
The term kill chain is a military concept related to the structure of an attack.  It consists of target identification, decision and order to attack the target, and finally the target destruction.Lockheed Martin, a global security and aerospace company, that established the Cyber Kill Chain® framework for the cybersecurity industry in 2011 based on the military concept. The framework defines the steps used by adversaries or malicious actors in cyberspace. <br>

To succeed, an adversary needs to go through all phases of the Kill Chain. We will go through the attack phases and help you better understand adversaries and their techniques used in the attack to defend yourself. <br>

The Cyber Kill Chain will help you understand and protect against ransomware attacks, security breaches as well as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). You can use the Cyber Kill Chain to assess your network and system security by identifying missing security controls and closing certain security gaps based on your company's infrastructure. <br>

By understanding the Kill Chain as a SOC Analyst, Security Researcher, Threat Hunter, or Incident Responder, you will be able to recognize the intrusion attempts and understand the intruder's goals and objectives. <br>

**Phases of Cyber Kill Chain** <br>
**1. Reconnaissance** <br> - Reconnaissance(Information Gathering) is discovering and collecting information on the system and the victim.OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) also falls under reconnaissance.The attacker needs to study the victim by collecting every available piece of information on the company and its employees, such as the company's size, email addresses, phone numbers from publicly available resources to determine the best target for the attack.  <br>

Email harvesting is the process of obtaining email addresses from public, paid, or free services. An attacker can use email-address harvesting for a phishing attack (a type of social-engineering attack used to steal sensitive data, including login credentials and credit card numbers). The attacker will have a big arsenal of tools available for reconnaissance purposes. <br>

theHarvester - other than gathering emails, this tool is also capable of gathering names, subdomains, IPs, and URLs using multiple public data sources <br>
Hunter.io - this is  an email hunting tool that will let you obtain contact information associated with the domain <br>
OSINT Framework - OSINT Framework provides the collection of OSINT tools based on various categories <br>

An attacker would also use social media websites such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to collect information on a specific victim he would want to attack or the company. The information found on social media can be beneficial for an attacker to conduct a phishing attack. <br>

**2. Weaponization** <br> -  crafting a "weapon of destruction". Intruder creates remote access malware weapon, such as a virus or worm, tailored to one or more vulnerabilities. <br>

**Malware** is a program or software that is designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to a computer. <br>

An **exploit** is a program or a code that takes advantage of the vulnerability or flaw in the application or system. <br>

A **payload** is a malicious code that the attacker runs on the system. <br>

Create an infected Microsoft Office document containing a malicious macro or VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) scripts. If you want to learn about macro and VBA, please refer to the article "Intro to Macros and VBA For Script Kiddies" by TrustedSec. <br>
An attacker can create a malicious payload or a very sophisticated worm, implant it on the USB drives, and then distribute them in public. An example of the virus.  <br>
An attacker would choose Command and Control (C2) techniques for executing the commands on the victim's machine or deliver more payloads. You can read more about the C2 techniques on MITRE ATT&CK. <br>
An attacker would select a backdoor implant (the way to access the computer system, which includes bypassing the security mechanisms). <br>

**3. Delivery** <br> - Intruder transmits weapon to target or decides to choose the method for transmitting the payload or the malware. (e.g., via e-mail attachments, websites or USB drives).<br>

- Phishing email
- Distributing infected USB drives in public places like coffee shops, parking lots, or on the street.
- Watering hole attack.(An attack where a legitimate website frequently visited by a target is compromised and geared towards infecting visitors with malware.)This type of attack is called a drive-by download. An example can be a malicious pop-up asking to download a fake Browser extension.


**4. Exploitation** <br> - To gain access to the system, an attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability. <br> After gaining access to the system, the malicious actor could exploit software, system, or server-based vulnerabilities to escalate the privileges or move laterally through the network. <br>

**lateral movement** refers to the techniques that a malicious actor uses after gaining initial access to the victim's machine to move deeper into a network to obtain sensitive data. <br> 

Examples of Exploitations<br>
- The victim triggers the exploit by opening the email attachment or clicking on a malicious link.
- Using a zero-day exploit.
- Exploit software, hardware, or even human vulnerabilities. 
- An attacker triggers the exploit for server-based vulnerabilities.
  
**5. Installation** <br> - Malware weapon installs an access point (e.g., "backdoor"  A backdoor is also known as an access point.) usable by the intruder, the backdoor lets an attacker bypass security measures and hide the access.That is when the attacker needs to install a persistent backdoor. A persistent backdoor will let the attacker access the system he compromised in the past <br>

The persistence can be achieved through:<br>
- Installing web shell on the webserver.  A web shell is a malicious script written in web development programming languages such as ASP, PHP, or JSP used by an attacker to maintain access to the compromised system. Because of the web shell simplicity and file formatting (.php, .asp, .aspx, .jsp, etc.) can be difficult to detect and might be classified as benign.
  
- Installing a backdoor on the victim's machine. For example, the attacker can use Meterpreter to install a backdoor on the victim's machine. Meterpreter is a Metasploit Framework payload that gives an interactive shell from which an attacker can interact with the victim's machine remotely and execute the malicious code.
  
- Creating or modifying Windows services. This technique is known as T1543.003 on MITRE ATT&CK (MITRE ATT&CK® is a knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world scenarios). An attacker can create or modify the Windows services to execute the malicious scripts or payloads regularly as a part of the persistence. An attacker can use the tools like sc.exe (sc.exe lets you Create, Start, Stop, Query, or Delete any Windows Service) and Reg to modify service configurations. The attacker can also masquerade the malicious payload by using a service name that is known to be related to the Operating System or legitimate software.
  
- Adding the entry to the "run keys" for the malicious payload in the Registry or the Startup Folder. By doing that, the payload will execute each time the user logs in on the computer. According to MITRE ATT&CK, there is a startup folder location for individual user accounts and a system-wide startup folder that will be checked no matter what user account logs in.

In this phase, the attacker can also use the Timestomping technique to avoid detection by the forensic investigator and also to make the malware appear as a part of a legitimate program. The Timestomping technique lets an attacker modify the file's timestamps, including the modify, access, create and change times. <br>

**6. Command & Control (C2)** <br> - Malware enables intruder to have "hands on the keyboard" persistent access to the target network.The infected host will consistently communicate with the C2 server; that is also where the beaconing term came from.<br>

After getting persistence and executing the malware on the victim's machine, "Megatron" opens up the C2 (Command and Control) channel through the malware to remotely control and manipulate the victim. This term is also known as C&C or C2 Beaconing as a type of malicious communication between a C&C server and malware on the infected host.<br>

The most common C2 channels used by adversaries nowadays: <br>

- The protocols HTTP on port 80 and HTTPS on port 443 - this type of beaconing blends the malicious traffic with the legitimate traffic and can help the attacker evade firewalls.  
- DNS (Domain Name Server). The infected machine makes constant DNS requests to the DNS server that belongs to an attacker, this type of C2 communication is also known as DNS Tunneling.

Important to note that an adversary or another compromised host can be the owner of the C2 infrastructure.<br>

**7. Action on Objectives** <br> - Intruder takes action to achieve their goals, such as data exfiltration, data destruction, or encryption for ransom.

- Collect the credentials from users.
- Perform privilege escalation (gaining elevated access like domain administrator access from a workstation by exploiting the misconfiguration).
- Internal reconnaissance (for example, an attacker gets to interact with internal software to find its vulnerabilities).
- Lateral movement through the company's environment.
- Collect and exfiltrate sensitive data.
- Deleting the backups and shadow copies. Shadow Copy is a Microsoft technology that can create backup copies, snapshots of computer files, or volumes. 
- Overwrite or corrupt data.
