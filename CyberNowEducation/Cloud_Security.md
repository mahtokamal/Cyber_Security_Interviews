# Cloud Security

## Fundamentals of Cloud Security
**Benefits of Cloud Migration**<br>
- Resource pooling: You can take benefits of resource such as hardware infrastructure, network, computing etc.
- Self Service: It refers the kind of service you use for personal or oraganizations and if requirements gets increased in time you can add more on-demand service.
- Pay per use: it means just pay when you are using and won't be charged in idle or turned OFF conditons.
- 

## Cloud Computing Models
**Coud Service Modes**<br>
- Software as a Service:
- Platform as a Service: Developer doesn't have to take care of Operation System platforms, 
- Infrastructure as a Service:

**Cloud Deployment Models**<br>
- Public Cloud: aceessible and available to everyone
- Private Cloud: aceessible and available within organization boundaries
- Hybrid Cloud: Combination of Public and Private Cloud
- Community Cloud: Platform where liked-minded community or professional interact.
- Multi-Cloud: It leverages to use more one cloud platforms from various cloud service providers(Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform(GCP))

## Cloud Service Providers
Followig are the main Cloud Service Providers (CSP) based on currrent cloud market trends:
- Amazon Web Services(AWS)
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platforms(GCP)
- Alibaba Cloud: China and south Asia
- IBM Cloud: Specialized for providing bare-metal service trageting private cloud deployment models
- Oracle Cloud: Known for Database Services.

**How to choose Cloud Service Providers?**
The decision of choosing cloud service providers depends on various factors such as budget, business requirements, infrastructure, application etc. 
- Support:
- Service Levels(SLA):
- Costs:
- Security:
- Compliance(standards):
- Data Residency (geographical data storage and management):

## Risks in Cloud Security

- Lack of cloud security skills:
- Misconfigurations: Data breaches,
- Increased attack surface:
- Lack of focus in security cloud identities: SSO
- Lack of standardization and visibility:
- Data leakage:
- Data privacy and compliance:
- Data sovereignty, residence, and control:
- Incident response in the cloud:

## Cloud Security Principles
**What is Cloud Security?** <br>
Cloud Security are tools, technologies, process and control that are implemented to secure your cloud environmnets.

**What Cloud Security is Not ?** <br>
- On-Premise security happening in a new environments.
- A product that you buy and forget!
- A sub-task that the cybersecurity team does when they are free.
- A standard that you get certified against.
- A policy that gets approved and put on the employee portal and forgotten

**The Cloud Security Models?** <br>
1. Cloud Security Principles
2. Cloud Securtiy Governance Frameworks

**Cloud Security Principles**
- Shared Responsibility
- The Identity perimeter
- Zero Trust Architecture: The term coined in 2010, Zero Trust is not a product or tools, it's a concept. Zero Trust means, that you do not trust anything i.e. service or user either within or outside the network and verify everything.
- Security as Code
 **API calls** <br>
 **Serverless** <br>
- Automation in Incident Response
- Threat Intelligence

## Cloud Security Governance

**What is cloud Security Governance?** <br>
Cloud Security Governance is not:<br>
- A tool or commercial product which you implement
- A policy that you write and then forget about after passing an audit:
- A checklist
- A standard
- A certification which you acquire.

Cloud Security Governance refers to a formal management model / framework you put into place to make sure all the cloud security processes remain working and functional

**Cloud Security Policy and Standards** <br>

**Cloud Security Standards** <br>

**Cloud Security Organizations** <br>

**Cloud Security Engineer** <br>

**Skill needed include:** <br>

**Cloud Security Architects** <br>

**Cloud Security Manager** <br>

## Cloud Security Tooling

- Single-Sign-On(SSO) Solutiond

- Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB)

- Cloud Workload Protection Platforms (CWPP)

- Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Managers (CIEM)

- Cloud Security Posture Managers (CSPM)

## Cloud Security Certifications
2 Paths for Cloud security certifications

- Platform Agnostic: Certifications that are not bound to any specific platform like Google, Azure and AWS.
- Patform Specific: Certifications like AWS Security Speciality or Azure Security Engineer.

  **Platform Agnostic Certifications** <br>
  - CSA Security guidance fro critical areas of focus in cloud computing.
  - CSA Cloud Control Matrix.
  - Cloud Computing Risk Assessment.

  Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge (CCSK) <br>
  The CCSK exam is open-book and online. It contains 60 multiple-choice questions selected randomly from a larger pool, and you must complete it in 120 minutes. The minimum passing score is 80%.<br>

  Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP) Certification

**Platform Specific Certifications** <br>
- AWS Certified Security Specialty
- Microsoft Azure Security Engineer Associate
- Google Cloud Security Engineer

## Landing the Job
- Getting Cloud Security experience without a job
- Polishing up your profile
- Creating your brand in the industry
- Acing the cloud security job interview

**Getting Cloud Security Experience without a Job** <br>
- Step 1: create a free cloud sandbox at home
- Step 2: Gets hands on with infrastructure as Code(IaC)
- Step 3: Scan your IaC templates fro Security issues
  Checkov is a free static code-analysis tool for IaC
- Step 4: Volunteer for Cloud Security experience

**Polishing up your profile** <br>
Two ways to find jobs:
- Going to where the jobs are.
- Making the jobs come to you.
  Linkedin <br>

**Creating your brand in the industry** <br>
  Medium Blog <br>
  Conference <br>
  Creating a Course
 
 **Acing the cloud security interview** <br>
 - How much experience do you have in the Cloud?
   IaC Teraform, CheckOV
 - Explain Iaas, Pass, Saas modules
   Iaas (servers, networks, etc.) <br>
   Paas deploy applications without worrying about provisioning the infrastructure <br>
   SaaS almost completely managed by the Vendor (Gmail, DropBoxx, Microsoft 365) <br>

- Have you been a part of Cloud Migrations?

- How would you secure multi-cloud environments?
- What are the uniqur security challenges of using the cloud?
  Less Control <br>
  Risk of data leakage<br>
  Compliance<br>
  Misconfigurations<br>

- Do you have any experience with Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

## Intro Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

**Benefits of IaC** <br>
- Easy environment duplication
- Reduced Configuration Errors
- Iterate on Best-Practice Environments

## How does IaC work?

Immutable Vs mutable infrastructure
- Immutable infrastructure is favored for cloud and microservices environments.

**Approaches to Iac** <br>
There are two approaches to Iac:<br>
- Declarative
- Imperative


Provisioning Tool <br>
State Management <br>
Commercial Version <br>

## IAC - installing Terraform

**Installing Terraform to MaC** <br>
**step 1: Open terminal**<br>
type: brew install terraform <b>

**step 2: To verify**<br>
type: terraform -help <br>
type: terraform -help plan <br>
type: terraform -install-autocomplete

**Installing Terraform on Windows** <br>
Step 1: Open Powershell<br>
powerhsell: curl.exe -O https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.12.26/terraform_0.12.26_windows_amd64.zip <br>
powerhsell: Expand-Archive terraform_0.12.26_windows_amd64.zip <br>
powerhsell: Rename-Item -path .\terraform_0.12.26_windows_amd64\ .\terraform <br>
powerhsell: cd terraform <br>
powerhsell: pwd <br>
Then copy the path of terraform and paste it on environments variables <br>

Now, you'll be able to run terraform command from anywhere in a file system <br>

type: terraform <br>
cd C:\ (hit enter) <br>
terraform -help <br>
