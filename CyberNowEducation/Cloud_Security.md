# Cloud Security

## Fundamentals of Cloud Security
**Benefits of Cloud Migration**<br>
- Resource pooling: You can take benefits of resource such as hardware infrastructure, network, computing etc.
- Self Service: It refers the kind of service you use for personal or oraganizations and if requirements gets increased in time you can add more on-demand service.
- Pay per use: it means just pay when you are using and won't be charged in idle or turned OFF conditons.
- 

## Cloud Computing Models
**Coud Service Modes**<br>
- Software as a Service:
- Platform as a Service: Developer doesn't have to take care of Operation System platforms, 
- Infrastructure as a Service:

**Cloud Deployment Models**<br>
- Public Cloud: aceessible and available to everyone
- Private Cloud: aceessible and available within organization boundaries
- Hybrid Cloud: Combination of Public and Private Cloud
- Community Cloud: Platform where liked-minded community or professional interact.
- Multi-Cloud: It leverages to use more one cloud platforms from various cloud service providers(Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform(GCP))

## Cloud Service Providers
Followig are the main Cloud Service Providers (CSP) based on currrent cloud market trends:
- Amazon Web Services(AWS)
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platforms(GCP)
- Alibaba Cloud: China and south Asia
- IBM Cloud: Specialized for providing bare-metal service trageting private cloud deployment models
- Oracle Cloud: Known for Database Services.

**How to choose Cloud Service Providers?**
The decision of choosing cloud service providers depends on various factors such as budget, business requirements, infrastructure, application etc. 
- Support:
- Service Levels(SLA):
- Costs:
- Security:
- Compliance(standards):
- Data Residency (geographical data storage and management):

## Risks in Cloud Security

- Lack of cloud security skills:
- Misconfigurations: Data breaches,
- Increased attack surface:
- Lack of focus in security cloud identities: SSO
- Lack of standardization and visibility:
- Data leakage:
- Data privacy and compliance:
- Data sovereignty, residence, and control:
- Incident response in the cloud:

## Cloud Security Principles
**What is Cloud Security?** <br>
Cloud Security are tools, technologies, process and control that are implemented to secure your cloud environmnets.

**What Cloud Security is Not ?** <br>
- On-Premise security happening in a new environments.
- A product that you buy and forget!
- A sub-task that the cybersecurity team does when they are free.
- A standard that you get certified against.
- A policy that gets approved and put on the employee portal and forgotten

**The Cloud Security Models?** <br>
1. Cloud Security Principles
2. Cloud Securtiy Governance Frameworks

**Cloud Security Principles**
- Shared Responsibility
- The Identity perimeter
- Zero Trust Architecture: The term coined in 2010, Zero Trust is not a product or tools, it's a concept. Zero Trust means, that you do not trust anything i.e. service or user either within or outside the network and verify everything.
- Security as Code
 **API calls** <br>
 **Serverless** <br>
- Automation in Incident Response
- Threat Intelligence

## Cloud Security Governance

**What is cloud Security Governance?** <br>
Cloud Security Governance is not:<br>
- A tool or commercial product which you implement
- A policy that you write and then forget about after passing an audit:
- A checklist
- A standard
- A certification which you acquire.

Cloud Security Governance refers to a formal management model / framework you put into place to make sure all the cloud security processes remain working and functional

**Cloud Security Policy and Standards** <br>

**Cloud Security Standards** <br>

**Cloud Security Organizations** <br>

**Cloud Security Engineer** <br>

**Skill needed include:** <br>

**Cloud Security Architects** <br>

**Cloud Security Manager** <br>

- Single-Sign-On(SSO) Solutiond

- Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB)

- Cloud Workload Protection Platforms (CWPP)

- Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Managers (CIEM)

- Cloud Security Posture Managers (CSPM)

## Cloud Security Certifications
2 Paths for Cloud security certifications

- Platform Agnostic: Certifications that are not bound to any specific platform like Google, Azure and AWS.
- Patform Specific: Certifications like AWS Security Speciality or Azure Security Engineer.

  **Platform Agnostic Certifications** <br>
  - CSA Security guidance fro critical areas of focus in cloud computing.
  - CSA Cloud Control Matrix.

## Intro Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

**Benefits of IaC** <br>
- Easy environment duplication
- Reduced Configuration Errors
- Iterate on Best-Practice Environments

## How does IaC work?

Immutable Vs mutable infrastructure
- Immutable infrastructure is favored for cloud and microservices environments.

**Approaches to Iac** <br>
There are two approaches to Iac:<br>
- Declarative
- Imperative


Provisioning Tool <br>
State Management <br>
Commercial Version <br>

## IAC - installing Terraform

**Installing Terraform to MaC** <br>
**step 1: Open terminal**<br>
type: brew install terraform <b>

Hands-On with Terraform Microsoft Azure <br>
**Let's understand Terraform loop first**

- Init: Initialize the (local) Terraform environment. Usually executed only once per session.
- Plan: Compare the Terraform state with the as-is state in the cloud, build and display an execution plan. This does not change the deployment (read-only).
- Apply: Apply the plan from the plan phase. This potentially changes the deployment (read and write).
- Destroy all resources that are governed by this specific terraform environment.

- Now, Open powershell and type az login (a GUI prompt appears that let you log into Microsoft Azure, enter you azure user account and password) and proceed to continue
- After logged in, subscription name, tenant and Subscription ID will show and enter "1" for selected Subscription ID
- Then, az account show (In the output in the terminal, find the ID of the subscription that you want to use:)
- {
- "environmentName": "AzureCloud",
- "homeTenantId": "0envbwi39-home-Tenant-Id",
- "id": "35akss-subscription-id",
- "isDefault": true,
- "managedByTenants": [],
- "name": "Subscription-Name",
- "state": "Enabled",
- "tenantDefaultDomain": ""
- "tenantDisplayName": "Default Directory"
- "tenantId": "0envbwi39-TenantId",
- "user": {
- "name": "your-username@domain.com",
- "type": "user"
- }

Once you have chosen the account subscription ID, set the account with the Azure CLI.
- az account set --subscription "your-subscription-ID"
![Screenshot (533)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdc02d03-0ce8-414a-b89e-f67e166d2803)

Next, we create a Service Principal. A Service Principal is an application within Azure Active Directory with the authentication tokens Terraform needs to perform actions on your behalf. Update the <SUBSCRIPTION_ID> with the subscription ID you specified in the previous step.
- az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"

The output includes credentials that you must protect. Be sure that you do not include these credentials in your code or check the credentials into your source control. For more information, see the assignment details

## IAC- Scanning for Misconfigurations
**Checking for Misconfigurations with Checkov** <br>
Checkov is a static code analysis tool for scanning infrastructure as code (IaC) files for misconfigurations that may lead to security or compliance problems. Checkov includes more than 750 predefined policies to check for common misconfiguration issues.  Checkov also supports the creation and contribution of custom policies. 


Supported IaC types
Checkov scans these IaC file types:


- Terraform (for AWS, GCP, Azure and OCI)
- CloudFormation (including AWS SAM)
- Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
- Serverless framework
- Helm charts
- Kubernetes
- Docker


This lab shows how to install Checkov, run a scan, and analyze the results.


Install Pip3 and Python
pip3 is the official package manager and pip command for Python 3. It enables the installation and management of third party software packages with features and functionality not found in the Python standard library. Pip3 installs packages from PyPI (Python Package Index).


You can get it by installing the latest version of python here.


Install Checkov From PyPI Using Pip

pip3 install checkov

Make Terraform Directory and Move There

mkdir ~/checkov-example
cd ~/checkov-example

Create main.tf file with VS Code

code main.tf

Paste Code into File, Save, then Exit

Make sure there are no copy and paste extra characters in your code.


resource "aws_s3_bucket" "foo-bucket" {
#same resource configuration as previous example, but acl set for public access.
acl = "public-read"
}
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

Format the file

terraform fmt

Execute Checkov

Make sure you're in the directory that your Terraform is in.


checkov -f main.tf

Results

<img width="1819" height="380" alt="Screenshot (686)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c513f18-6324-46e1-86fe-72d4d6d411c5" />

It's that simple.  As you can see Checkov runs and it notes that versioning was not enabled for that resource.  Checkov checks for all common configuration and security errors in your Terraform code BEFORE deploying it.  Anytime you download a Terraform script to execute in your environment, you will want to run Checkov to make sure that it meets your standards for configuration.

## Serverless Functions - AWS Lambda


- open the function page with lambda console (type "lambda" in the search field and enter)
- Then, create function
- select author from scratch
- Under Function name"myLambdaFunction"
- Runtime "Python 3.13"
- Architecture default x86_x64
- create function
- lambda creates a function and returns a function "Hello From Lambda"
- lamda also creates an execution roles for your functions (an execution role is an AWS Identity and Access Management roles that grants lambda functions permission to access AWS services and resources).For your function, the role that Lambda creates grants basic permissions to write to CloudWatch Logs.

Now, use the console's built-in code editor to replace the Hello world code that Lambda created with own function code.
- Choose the Code tab. In the console's built-in code editor, you should see the function code that Lambda created. If you don't see the lambda_function.py tab in the code editor, select lambda_function.py in the file explorer.


![Screenshot (694)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b8d3bcc-2978-4760-bec7-6f7da4982af3)

- Paste the following code into the lambda_function.py tab, replacing the code that Lambda created. <br>

import json <br>
import logging <br>
 
logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
 
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    
    #Get the length and width parameters from the event object. The 
    #runtime converts the event object to a Python dictionary
    length=event['length']
    width=event['width']
    
    area = calculate_area(length, width)
    print(f"The area is {area}")
        
    logger.info(f"CloudWatch logs group: {context.log_group_name}")
    
    #return the calculated area as a JSON string
    data = {"area": area}
    return json.dumps(data)
    
def calculate_area(length, width):
    return length*width

## Understanding your function code
Before you move to the next step, let's take a moment to look at the function code and understand some key Lambda concepts.

The Lambda handler:Your Lambda function contains a Python function named lambda_handler. A Lambda function in Python can contain more than one Python function, but the handler function is always the entry point to your code. When your function is invoked, Lambda runs this method.

When you created your Hello world function using the console, Lambda automatically set the name of the handler method for your function to lambda_handler. Be sure not to edit the name of this Python function. If you do, Lambda won’t be able to run your code when you invoke your function.


The Lambda event object:The function lambda_handler takes two arguments, event and context. An event in Lambda is a JSON formatted document that contains data for your function to process.If your function is invoked by another AWS service, the event object contains information about the event that caused the invocation. For example, if an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket invokes your function when an object is uploaded, the event will contain the name of the Amazon S3 bucket and the object key.In this example, you’ll create an event in the console by entering a JSON formatted document with two key-value pairs.


The Lambda context object:The second argument your function takes is context. Lambda passes the context object to your function automatically. The context object contains information about the function invocation and execution environment.

You can use the context object to output information about your function's invocation for monitoring purposes. In this example, your function uses the log_group_name parameter to output the name of its CloudWatch log group.


Logging in Lambda:With Python, you can use either a print statement or a Python logging library to send information to your function's log. To illustrate the difference in what's captured, the example code uses both methods. In a production application, we recommend that you use a logging library.


Invoke the Lambda function using the console

To invoke your function using the Lambda console, you first create a test event to send to your function. The event is a JSON formatted document containing two key-value pairs with the keys "length" and "width".

## To create the test event:
- In the Code source pane, choose Test.

- Select Create new event.

- For Event name enter myTestEvent.

- In the Event JSON panel, replace the default values by pasting in the following:
{
"length": 6,
"width": 7
}

- Choose Save.

![Screenshot (702)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70bfead9-e699-4eba-974f-b419287c90fd)


You now test your function and use the Lambda console and CloudWatch Logs to view records of your function’s invocation.

## To test your function and view invocation records in the console
In the Code source pane, choose Test. When your function finishes running, you’ll see the response and function logs displayed in the Execution results tab.


In this example, you invoked your code using the console's test feature. This means that you can view your function's execution results directly in the console. When your function is invoked outside the console, you need to use CloudWatch Logs.

![Screenshot (705)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30108147-d043-405c-b8ef-41440b0c60ee)

## To view your function's invocation records in CloudWatch Logs
- Open the Log groups page of the CloudWatch console.
