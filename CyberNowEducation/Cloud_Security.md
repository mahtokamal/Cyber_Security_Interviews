# Cloud Security

## Fundamentals of Cloud Security
**Benefits of Cloud Migration**<br>
- Resource pooling: You can take benefits of resource such as hardware infrastructure, network, computing etc.
- Self Service: It refers the kind of service you use for personal or oraganizations and if requirements gets increased in time you can add more on-demand service.
- Pay per use: it means just pay when you are using and won't be charged in idle or turned OFF conditons.
- 

## Cloud Computing Models
**Coud Service Modes**<br>
- Software as a Service:
- Platform as a Service: Developer doesn't have to take care of Operation System platforms, 
- Infrastructure as a Service:

**Cloud Deployment Models**<br>
- Public Cloud: aceessible and available to everyone
- Private Cloud: aceessible and available within organization boundaries
- Hybrid Cloud: Combination of Public and Private Cloud
- Community Cloud: Platform where liked-minded community or professional interact.
- Multi-Cloud: It leverages to use more one cloud platforms from various cloud service providers(Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform(GCP))

## Cloud Service Providers
Followig are the main Cloud Service Providers (CSP) based on currrent cloud market trends:
- Amazon Web Services(AWS)
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platforms(GCP)
- Alibaba Cloud: China and south Asia
- IBM Cloud: Specialized for providing bare-metal service trageting private cloud deployment models
- Oracle Cloud: Known for Database Services.

**How to choose Cloud Service Providers?**
The decision of choosing cloud service providers depends on various factors such as budget, business requirements, infrastructure, application etc. 
- Support:
- Service Levels(SLA):
- Costs:
- Security:
- Compliance(standards):
- Data Residency (geographical data storage and management):

## Risks in Cloud Security

- Lack of cloud security skills:
- Misconfigurations: Data breaches,
- Increased attack surface:
- Lack of focus in security cloud identities: SSO
- Lack of standardization and visibility:
- Data leakage:
- Data privacy and compliance:
- Data sovereignty, residence, and control:
- Incident response in the cloud:

## Cloud Security Principles
**What is Cloud Security?** <br>
Cloud Security are tools, technologies, process and control that are implemented to secure your cloud environmnets.

**What Cloud Security is Not ?** <br>
- On-Premise security happening in a new environments.
- A product that you buy and forget!
- A sub-task that the cybersecurity team does when they are free.
- A standard that you get certified against.
- A policy that gets approved and put on the employee portal and forgotten

**The Cloud Security Models?** <br>
1. Cloud Security Principles
2. Cloud Securtiy Governance Frameworks

**Cloud Security Principles**
- Shared Responsibility
- The Identity perimeter
- Zero Trust Architecture: The term coined in 2010, Zero Trust is not a product or tools, it's a concept. Zero Trust means, that you do not trust anything i.e. service or user either within or outside the network and verify everything.
- Security as Code
 **API calls** <br>
 **Serverless** <br>
- Automation in Incident Response
- Threat Intelligence
