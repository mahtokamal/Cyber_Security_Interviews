MSSP (Managed Security Service Providers.)

ex- CISCO(Networking devices and equipments), Palo Alto Networks <br>

Fortinet (SOC-based services, Cloud security solutions) <br>

Cloud security (Azure, AWS, GCP) <br>

Okta (IAM , SSO, MFA user activity monitoring) <br>

Qualys (Risk & Vulnerability Management Software) <br>

Anivirus (McAfee, Quick Heal, ) <br>

IDS/IPS <br>

Firewall, <br>
VPN <br>
   
  - Firewalls
  - IDPS
  - VPN
  - Antivirus services (Quick Heal, Mcafee)
  - Vulnearbility Scanning
  - Endpoint Protections
  - Incident response services
  - Security consulting
  - Security information and event management (SIEM
   -Threat detection and prevention (IDPS, EDR, XDR)
8. EDR[(Endpoint Detection and Response)Wazuh(Open-source)],
9. XDR [Extended detection and response]
10.  EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response), have been created because antiviruses cannot catch every malicious binary and process running on the endpoint. 
11. IDPS(Snort, Suricata)
12. SOAR [(Security Orchestration Automation and Response)]
    Real-life example: Zensar’s Cybersecurity Team uses SOAR for faster email phishing attacks & incident response. The security team has automated the security investigation process by manually searching for threats. <br>

    CrowdStrike Falcon® Fusion SOAR for security analysis

    - Use cases - Threat Hunting, Case Management, Threat Intelligence Coordination Automation, Vulnerability Management, Automated Phishing Attacks Investigation, Analysis & Response, Automated Remediation, Incident Response, Endpoint Protection, Forensic Investigation, Cloud security orchestration, Incident lifecycle case management, SSL certificate expiration tracking, Detecting suspicious user login from IP address locations.

## Cyber Security Tools info
### Packet Sniffers tools
1. Wiresharks - A popular open-source packet analyzer with advanced features and support for various platforms.
2. tcpdump - A command-line packet sniffer and analyzer primarily used in Unix-based systems.
3. Npcap - A packet capture framework for Windows that supports Windows 10 and newer versions.

### Port Scanner tools
1. Nmap - Nmap (Network Mapper) is a free, open-source tool that is highly versatile and powerful. It offers various types of scans, including TCP Connect, TCP SYN, and UDP scans.
2. Masscan -  Masscan is a high-speed port scanner that is typically used for large-scale scanning, thanks to its ability to scan the entire internet within a few minutes.
3. Angry IP Scanner - It is a cross-platform port scanner that is very user-friendly and suitable for beginners. It supports both TCP and UDP scanning.
