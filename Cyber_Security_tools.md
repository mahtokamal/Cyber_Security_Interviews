-  Metadefender Cloud - OPSWAT
- bevigil.com
Industry’s first security search engine for Mobile Threats. Search and uncover Digital Footprints, Supply Chain and threats associated with any mobile app for free of cost.

With BeVigil , users can now ascertain the risk rating of an app, check the list of permissions it requests on installation, and ensure it is not malicious. BeVigil’s familiar and easy-to-use search engine interface allows users to simply search for the app name to get a risk score that is indicative of the app’s overall security posture. Moreover, app developers can proactively upload their applications to BeVigil to identify vulnerabilities and remediate them, avoiding any pitfalls prior to their launch.

## For Level 1 SOC Analysts, typical job responsibilities include:
Proactive monitoring of network traffic and events
Creating tickets
Investigating alerts
Remediation steps
Closing alerts
Triaging the incident and coordinating with Level 2 SOC Analysts
As Level 1 SOC Analysts gain more experience, they can then choose to progress to become a Level 2 SOC Analyst, Level 3 SOC Analyst, SOC Engineer/Architect, or SOC Manager.

## SOC L1 Pre-requisites Skills
Network Fundamentals - the core concepts of how computers communicate with each other are important to understand before learning how to attack and defend networks
Web Application Technologies - learn the building blocks of the world wide web to understand how to attack web applications
Linux Fundamentals - Many servers and security tools use Linux. Learn how to use the Linux operating system, a critical skill in cyber security
Windows Fundamentals - Get hands-on access to Windows and its security controls. These basics will help you in identifying, exploiting and defending Windows
SOC Analysts must also have soft skills like critical thinking, problem-solving, independence, resilience, and logical thinking.

## IT Support roles
## Stay Updated and Keeping up with the industry trends and technology
Here are a number of researchers, influencers, and key content creators in the field that share the very latest in defensive security, including Katie Paxton-Fear, Nicole Enesse, Simply Cyber, Florian Roth, Chris Greer, Alyssa Miller, Tracy Z. Maleef, Lesley Carhart, and Marcus J. Carey.

We also recommend regularly keeping up with ThreatPost, The Hacker News, PenTest Magazine, and the TryHackMe blog.

## SOC Roadmap
- SOC L1 (Analysts)
- SOC L2 (Analyst or Incident Responders)
- SOc L3 (Threat Hunter or Malware Analysts)
- SOC Manager
- CISO
