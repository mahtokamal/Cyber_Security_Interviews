## MITRE ATT & CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge)
MITRE ATT&CK(Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) framework, is a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. It helps to map and understand attacker behaviors during the kill chain.

It is a guideline for classifying and describing cyberattacks and intrusions. It was created by the Mitre Corporation and released in 2013 and used for threat modeling and profiling. The framework is an alternative to the cyber kill chain developed by Lockheed Martin.
